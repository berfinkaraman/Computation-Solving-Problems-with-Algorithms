    "Lie detection has been an issue since the existence of humankind. Verbal cues and physiological cues have been seen as two main ways to detect deception in a person's speech or testimony. Polygraphs are an example of a technology which tries to detect lies based on physiological cues such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc. Since polygraphs do not have the perfect streak on detecting lies, they are not widely used. Another problem with polygraphs is the fact that people can try to train their physiological responses if they have the insider information on the criteria of \"lying\" according to polygraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, verbal cues can be used to detect deception. According to various research, word choice in deceptive messages varies from people's normal word choice. Since linguistic factors can indicate lies, it means that there will be a linguistic pattern that can be detected to identify deceptive messages. According to research at Cornell University and University of British Columbia, three common patterns have been seen in the deceptive speeches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deceptive messages will contain more words than truthful messages. \n",
    "==> The main reason behind this phenomenon is trying to increase the engagement with the audience and make the lie more persuasive.\n",
    "- Liars will use fewer self-oriented and more other-oriented pronouns \n",
    "==> Liars tent to use \"they/their/she/he\" than \"I/my\". The psychological explanation behind this that liars tend to distance themselves from the lie.\n",
    "- Liars to use more non-committal phrases. \n",
    "==> Liars do not have to commit to a story since the story is their creation. Using non-committal words will help them to disattach it from the reality. Therefore, they tend to use non-committal words such as \"maybe,\" \"possibly,\" \"probably\" etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will build a lie detector that I can run my emails through so I can learn if there is a change that the other party is lying to me. If the output is positive, I can further research the situation. If it is negative, I can just trust the person who emailed me. This lie detector would be for only personal use, and it cannot be used as proof at a court.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a strategy, I can use the detected linguistic cue patterns to identify lies. However, it is unrealistic to blacklist these words because people still use words like \"they/their\" and \"probably\" in their nondeceptive text. Therefore, comparing the frequencies of these words appearing in the text can be a better way to implement a lie detector. In addition to that as I discussed linguistic cues are not the only indicator of lying. There are many other inputs that are not processed by my algorithm but still would be useful to be considered when we are questioning the truth value of a statement. Therefore, I can use my algorithm as one of the evidence of lying, but I would need more evidence to make sure the other party is lying. Also, I should not let another party to learn the logic behind my algorithm; otherwise they can train their word choice to fool the algorithm. As an improvement, I could have use machine learning to train my algorithm with word choosing style of each person individualy. Since my algorithm will be more familiar with the speaking style of each person, the error rate can be reduced. "

   "source": [
    "Basically, the main idea behind my algorithm is that searching multiple patterns in a given string/text. Multiple patterns will be the words that are correlated with lying, while the given string would be the emails that I received. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Brute Force Approach:\n",
    "Technically, I can use a brute force algorithm and try to match the array of the pattern with the parts of the main string. To make my brute force algorithm a little bit more efficient, I can try to match the first character of the pattern with the first character in the main string. If there is a match, I can keep trying to match the rest of the characters of the pattern. If any of the characters do not match, the program will keep iterating to find a match. Even though, it sounds like an easy implementation, it is not time efficient. The worst case scenario will happen if the main string and the pattern are the repetitions of the same character in different orders. The worst case time complexity would be the multiplication of the length of the main string (M) and the pattern (N) which can be expressed as O(MN) because the program will try to match each character of the pattern with each character in the main string. The following example is a good way to illustrate the worst case scenario, even though it is highly unlikely in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main string: xxxxxxxxxxxo\n",
    "Len(Main string) = 12\n",
    "Pattern: xxxxxo\n",
    "Len(Pattern) = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the brute force algorithm will try to match xxxxxo for each character of the main string because the first 5 character is the same. Thus for the program to find the match, it would need to iterate 12*6=72  times. Since I want my algorithm to search multiple strings (k), the worst case scenario time complexity will be O(kMN) which will not a be a good application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rabin-Karp\n",
    "The main problem that we faced in the brute force algorithm is that we have to compare each character one by one. If we can limit the number of comparisons that the program has to perform, we can optimize our solution. We learned that hash functions could transform the input with an arbitrary size into an input with a fixed size. Having a fixed size for the pattern can increase the efficiency of our solution. If we know the hash value of the pattern, we can look for the windows/substrings in the main string that has the same hash value and the same length with the pattern. If we meet these condition, it means that it is a match. However, due to a collision, a hash function has a false positive rate which means that two different string can have the same hash value. To prevent any noise due to the false positive rate of the hash function we can perform the character by charter comparison between the pattern and the window. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hash function that we should use should be uniform. In other words, the order of the characters should matter for the hash value. Otherwise \"probably\" and \"olabpbry\" will have the same has value. This will increase the number of collisions and require more comparison than a uniform hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling hash can be used as the hash function to compute the hash value of the window in the most optimal way. Rolling hash is a recursive hashing. Rabin Karp algorithm uses a polynomial rolling hash. Polynomial rolling hash finds the value of a string via multiplications and additions to keep track of the order of the characters while having an easy method to add a new character at the end while removing the first character of the substring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let a be a constant number.\n",
    "Let n be the hash values of each character.\n",
    "Let i be the index number of the character. \n",
    "Let H be the hash value of the substring.\n",
    "$$ H = n_1a^{(1-1)} + n_2a^{(2-1)} + n_3a^{(3-1)} + ... + n_ia^{(i-1)}  $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new character and remove the first character in the string we can follow the algorithm bellow:\n",
    "1. We will substract the hash value of the first character to remove its value from H. \n",
    "2. Then we will divide H with a. In that case we will have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ n_2a^{(2-2)} + n_3a^{(3-2)} + ... + n_ia^{(i-2)}  $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This equation illutrates that the first value is removed and the index values of each character is got one less which means that they shift one left. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lastly to add the new character and relate it to its index, we will add the hash value of the new character and multiply it with \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^{(i-1)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, using the rolling hash function will help us to optimize our solution by preventing the algorithm to recompute the hash value of each character each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The worst-case scenario for Rabin-Karp is the case when all characters of the main string and the pattern are same, so the hash values of each window will match the pattern. In that case, it will become the almost same as the brute force algorithm that we discussed above because the program has to compare each string one by one. The worst case time complexity is O((M-(N+1))N) becuase the number of comaprision that will be made still be less than trying each value since the progra compares based on the window size. Thus, Rabin-Karp will be more efficient because it is worst case scenario is less likely and a little bit more efficient compared to the brute force algorithm. Also, the average and best case time complexity of Rabin-Karp is O(M+N) which is a more common scenarios than the worst case. M comes from the number of hash value comparison and in addition that N is the time complexity for searching the window. If we are looking for k pattern in one list the time compleity would be O(k(M+N)). \n",

    "\n",
    "After I run my email on my program, I conclude that the email that I received didn't have enough lie indicator. Since I continue this conversation in real life, I know that the person wasn't lying. However, I need more test to establish the success of my program. As I discussed before this program cannot be used for an absolute conclusion whether a statement is a lie or truth. In addition to that this program evaluates the overall text thus it may overlook small lies or a sentence that was a lie. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as I was creating this program, I realized other possible applications of the program. The string searching can be used for a spam detector. If you identify spam email related words such as \"Free Coupon,\" \"Congratulations\", etc., you can assign a spam value to each email and avoid reading unnecessary email. Another application can be a search engine for you to find the required research paper for your assignment. You can enter keywords that you are looking for and run various resources through this program to asses how related the source that you found. If it passes specific criteria, you can spend more time on deep reading. The last version partially sounds like any search engine, but without the biases, your searching engine has about you. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, this program can be improved via machine learning to give more accurate results or bloom filter to store more data for comparison. With the further improvements, it can turn into something people can use on a daily basis to ease some of their tasks."
