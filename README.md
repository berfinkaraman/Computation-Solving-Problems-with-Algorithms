# Computation-Solving-Problems-with-Algorithms

Apply core concepts in design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and computational problem-solving techniques to address complex problems. Hashing, searching, sorting, tree algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, backtracking, random number generation, and randomized algorithms are examples of algorithms you will learn to exploit to solve problems ranging from logistics to route optimization to DNA sequencing.
